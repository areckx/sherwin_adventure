Some slope stuff



//sprite_manager::initial_sprite_spawning_from_level_data_old() is bugged.
//I am not quite sure what the problem is, but I think it should be
//rewritten so that sprite_manager::init_the_player() is called from WITHIN
//sprite_manager::initial_sprite_spawning_from_level_data_old().  The
//"outer" function will find where in the level data the player's level
//data is stored.
